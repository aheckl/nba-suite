# NBA Suite

This repository contains a Java program that compares stats of NBA players.  

My intention for this project was mainly to learn how to create GUIs in Java.

Just run the JAR file to start the application. Sample inputs can be found in the folders *Spielerdateien*, *Team1* and *Team2*.
Further inputs can be downloaded from https://www.nba.com/stats/.
